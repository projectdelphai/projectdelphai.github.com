###What type of blog is this?###


For a while, I've been thinking of making a website/blog. It goes all the way back to when I was a wee lad. Having a blog was an interest of mine for various reasons. First and foremost, it had been about money. "Hey! An easy way to make money," I thought. Then I looked up how to make a blog and all the intricacies behind  one. I read. . . and read . . . and read. I soon realized that writing for money was a stupid idea.

A couple months later, I wanted a website again. This time, it was because I had started getting interested in computers. I decided to start with the basics-HTML and CSS. So I coded what I thought was some pretty good websites and looked into publishing them. And being a lowly of kid of ~14, had nowhere to put it. I had to either spend my life savings every month, or use some free hosting site like WordPress. However, I liked my hand-coded website and didn't want to give it up for some Wordpress theme. I almost thought of hosting it myself, and then realized a crucial fact. **I had no content.**

All the articles I had ever read on blogging  had a common rule: write good content or you won't get noticed; without good content, a fabulous looking site is useless. So I was out of luck. I gave up ever getting a website and I turned to other fields. Fast forward in my life and I've learned a couple things. 

Freshman year of high school, I built my computer and put Arch Linux on it. I didn't have enough money to get a Windows CD and Linux sounded like an interesting project for myself. I know many people discourage Linux newcomers from starting with Arch Linux, but I was a stubborn kid and wanted to start with a bleeding-edge system that I could customize however I wanted. And I loved it. I started learning ruby to code a YouTube radio for myself. I was tired of the YouTube design and format. I didn't want to watch videos, I wanted to listen to them. I quickly found out that when I had a project in mind, I learned quickly. By diving head-first into projects and coding, I learned a lot faster than by reading books.

Before I knew it, I had quite a bit of scripts and programs stored up. Most of my bigger projects were uploaded on Github, while my scripts were stored in /usr/local/bin. I had a half-filled notebook with notes I had written and ideas that had randomly popped up. I had a couple aliases stored due to the fact that I was tired of trying to find obscure posts where I had originally gleaned some important scrap of code. 

And then I read of Github pages. It was perfect. Free hosting and from a site that I used all the time. I had the perfect place to write down any of my notes and maybe even help others with similar problems. And so after about a month of deliberating, I created this site. It is by no means perfect and I take no credit for the theme (heavily based on [the Slash theme](http://zespia.tw/Octopress-Theme-Slash/)), but it works. It's hosted by Github and it uses Jekyll and Octopress. It's clean and minimal with no ads flashing in my face. And I don't need to pay for it all.

Now the main point of this post: the type of content that can be found here. I'm a naturally lazy person. I don't want to think up posts and write them and publish them as if they were essays. I understand no one's reading this right now (and probably not for a long time) and so I'm going to write it like I want to. It'll mostly be records of how I fixed problems I had or complex instructions that I had to puzzle out (Samba, Irssi etc). And maybe a post so that I don't have to keep reiterating the same thing to every newcomer on [r/raspberrypi](http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberrypi). So don't expect perfect posts. Most if not all will be ramblings of my mind that were passed through a spell-check and a (Flesch-Kincaid Reading Test)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test] so I know I'm half-awake and somewhat coherent. If anyone has any questions or requests for further information, you can leave a comment and I'll hopefully get back to you. 

Note: That first lorem ipsum post will probably stay forever. Cause its HISTORY and cause nobody probably gives a sh*t.

Note2: If you didn't realize, there are three links in this post and they don't show up easily and look the same as the rest of the test. I'll figure out why later and fix it soon. Hopefully.
