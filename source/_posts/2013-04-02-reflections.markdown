This is goint to be a firt of probably many posts in which I talk about articles that I've come across during the last couple weeks that have garned enough attention from me that I feel obligated to comment on it. However, rather than writing an actual post, I'll just comment on it and leave it. I'll slowly add my own observations to this post until it gets large enough and than publish and start on the next one. I got this idea when I wanted to say something or take note of an opinion, but didn't want to write a full-blown post on it. This type of post definitely has roots from [Allan McRae's](https://www.archlinux.org/developers/#allan) common [Interesting Links](http://allanmcrae.com/2013/03/interesting-links-march-2013/) posts.

###[Never Lock Your Cell Phone](http://rocketships.ca/blog/never-lock-your-cell-phone/) by Shannon Graham

in which she argues that one should never lock your cell phone, because she has found many times, that because of an unlocked cell phone, a person who found her cell phone could return it by looking through the top contacts. I politely disagree. While I admire Shannon's amazing luck of getting her cell phone back many times, I disagree that it is a good habit to leave phones unlocked. The reason we have passwords is so that others can't go and look through all the private stuff we have stored on phones from emails to stored passwords. Leaving unlocked phones around is asking for them to be rooted through. Yes, it allows the finder to return the phone but at the same time, they might have looked through or even deleted pictures as one lady did (how do you even accidently delete photos?). As people suggested in the comments, there are ways to get back a cell phone without leaving it unlocked such as tracking apps, calling it back constantly, or changed the background to have your contact information. I was surprised, however, that no one mentioned the obvious: why not just stick a label on to the back with your address on it or your email? This way, no matter what happens to the phone (it gets wet or wiped) or how tech-savvy the finder is (can't figure out how to use the phone), the finder can just look on the back and contact you about it.

###[Internet Explorer vs. Humanity](http://blog.timoxley.com/post/25077257844/internet-explorer-vs-humanity) by Tim Oxley

in which he argues that we should stop pandering towards the incompetant blithering idiots who use Internet Explorer. Yeah, I thought it was pretty harsh too. I don't agree with the tone as much especially considering that I do not see a relationship between curing cancer and using Internet Explorer. However, I do agree that people spend way too much time trying to cater to those use Internet Explorer. Yes, I realize that Internet Explorer is used by [50% of users](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/internet-explorer-10-almost-doubles-its-users-thanks-to-windows-7-release/), but this is because its set as a default on most computers. And why is that? Because it works. Many sites work on Internet Explorer and so tech companies find no reason to switch to something else. Now if websites just dropped support for Internet Explorer entirely, maybe we'd see a change. As more sites became incompatible with Internet Explorer, more users would switch to something else, and change would occur.{% fn_ref 1 %} While I don't believe that Internet Explorer is the spawn of hell, I don't think that we should be the ones catering to a broken product. If something is broken, let the product become better rather than making the consumers stoop to help it up.

###[Firefox 20](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/04/02/firefox-gives-you-more-control-over-your-privacy/)

I'm surprised more people aren't talking about this release. In Firefox 20, one can now open a Private Browsing Tab without closing the previous session. Now whenever I want to watch a youtube video that isn't music, I can just switch to a private tab rather than having to use multiple profiles with the Private Browsing Windows. This, I believe, was a large difference between Chrome and Firefox. Along with their memory reductions and Responsive Design View, I think that Firefox is definitely about the level that Chrome is now. Personally of course.

###Response Design View
This is a really great feature that I've found that allows me to test the responsive design of my website easily without a third-party application. It's under Web Developer in the menu in Firefox

###[Why no more comments?!](http://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2013/04/03/only-external-comments-allowed/)

I totally agree with this. What's up with people abhorrence with comments? I've seen it on youtube videos and *especially* on Tumblr blogs, and it confuses me. Do people not want feedback on their posts? If they're scared of that people will criticize the quality or content of their post, then make the quality better or explain themselves.. If they're afraid of trolls, just block them. Don't stifle conversation.

###Media

[Ready Player One](http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline/dp/0307887448) - A great book which I highly recomment. Not too graphic or anything. Would probably get a very light PG-13 if it was a movie. Reminded me of [For the Win](http://www.amazon.com/For-Win-Cory-Doctorow/dp/B004E3XII0) by Cory Doctorow which might have been what inspired it especially as Cory Doctorow was mentioned in his book (I won't spoil it). Apparently, there's [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) for it called [The Oasis](http://enter-the-oasis.com/) after the virtual world in the book. Haven't tried it out yet.

[Berserk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Berserk%20Manga&tag=spectrumnexus-20&index=blended&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) - Wow. This is a great series, but would definitely be rated R if a movie. It's pretty bad for any kid and even some adults probably, but its great. Violent and though-provoking at the same time. Haven't caught up all the way, but definitely going to stick with it until the end. For those of you who might want to read it online, read it on the [Spectrum Nexus](http://www.thespectrum.net/manga_scans/berserk/) which has higher quality scans even though they end up calling Gutts Gatts and Puck Paakk for half the time. 


###Footnotes

  {% fn %} Imagine if Google, Facebook, Youtube etc. stopped rendering properly on Internet Explorer. There would definitely an outrage and a rush on Microsoft's part to fix their product.
