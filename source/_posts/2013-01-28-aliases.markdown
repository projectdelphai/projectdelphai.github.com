So right now I'm not sure whether to post whenever I think of an alias or bashrc function or to collect them all here. For now, I'll just add to this post as I think of them. While not technically aliases, I'll mostly include functions that I've placed in bashrc because to me, they serve the same purpose: they fulfill a certain requirement with less typing.

**Backup File**

Renames file argument to <filename>.tmp to preserve a copy then renames file argument to <filename>.bk as backup. Finally it renames temp file to original filename as experiment file

	function bk() {
	    cp $1 $1.tmp
	    mv $1 $1.bk
	    mv $1.tmp $1
	}

**Deploy Octopress Site Changes**

This one is used to deploy any changes to my site. After creating a post or changing the html/css, I just have to type in "deploy '<git commit message'" and itwill publish the changes. It first generates the site and then deploys it. The next half adds all changed files, adds a commit message, and pushes to my github. The hardest part is just remembering to add that commit argument.

	function deploy() {
	    rake generate;
	    rake deploy;
	    git add .;
	    git commit $1;
	    git push origin source;
	  }


**Aliases**

View any usb drives that were plugged in. The later they appear, the later they were plugged in or registered.
	alias vdev='dmesg | grep -o "sd[a-z]" | uniq | tail'
