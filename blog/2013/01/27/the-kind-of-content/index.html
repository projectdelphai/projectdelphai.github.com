	<div class="entry-content"><h3>What type of blog is this?</h3>

<p>For a while, I&#8217;ve been thinking of making a website/blog. It goes all the way back to when I was a wee lad. Having a blog was an interest of mine for various reasons. First and foremost, it had been about money. &#8220;Hey! An easy way to make money,&#8221; I thought. Then I looked up how to make a blog and all the intricacies behind  one. I read&#8230; and read &#8230; and read. I soon realized that writing for money was a stupid idea.</p>

<p>&lt;! &#8211; more &#8211;></p>

<p>A couple months later, I wanted a website again. This time, it was because I had started getting interested in computers. I decided to start with the basics-HTML and CSS. So I coded what I thought was some pretty good websites and looked into publishing them. And being a lowly of kid of ~14, had nowhere to put it. I had to either spend my life savings every month, or use some free hosting site like WordPress. However, I liked my hand-coded website and didn&#8217;t want to give it up for some Wordpress theme. I almost thought of hosting it myself, and then realized a crucial fact. <strong>I had no content.</strong></p>

<p>All the articles I had ever read on blogging  had a common rule: write good content or you won&#8217;t get noticed; without good content, a fabulous looking site is useless. So I was out of luck. I gave up ever getting a website and I turned to other fields. Fast forward in my life and I&#8217;ve learned a couple things.</p>

<p>Freshman year of high school, I built my computer and put Arch Linux on it. I didn&#8217;t have enough money to get a Windows CD and Linux sounded like an interesting project for myself. I know many people discourage Linux newcomers from starting with Arch Linux, but I was a stubborn kid and wanted to start with a bleeding-edge system that I could customize however I wanted. And I loved it. I started learning ruby to code a YouTube radio for myself. I was tired of the YouTube design and format. I didn&#8217;t want to watch videos, I wanted to listen to them. I quickly found out that when I had a project in mind, I learned quickly. By diving head-first into projects and coding, I learned a lot faster than by reading books.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I had quite a bit of scripts and programs stored up. Most of my bigger projects were uploaded on Github, while my scripts were stored in /usr/local/bin. I had a half-filled notebook with notes I had written and ideas that had randomly popped up. I had a couple aliases stored due to the fact that I was tired of trying to find obscure posts where I had originally gleaned some important scrap of code.</p>

<p>And then I read of Github pages. It was perfect. Free hosting and from a site that I used all the time. I had the perfect place to write down any of my notes and maybe even help others with similar problems. And so after about a month of deliberating, I created this site. It is by no means perfect and I take no credit for the theme (heavily based on <a href="http://zespia.tw/Octopress-Theme-Slash/">the Slash theme</a>), but it works. It&#8217;s hosted by Github and it uses Jekyll and Octopress. It&#8217;s clean and minimal with no ads flashing in my face. And I don&#8217;t need to pay for it all.</p>

<p>Now the main point of this post: the type of content that can be found here. I&#8217;m a naturally lazy person. I don&#8217;t want to think up posts and write them and publish them as if they were essays. I understand no one&#8217;s reading this right now (and probably not for a long time) and so I&#8217;m going to write it like I want to. It&#8217;ll mostly be records of how I fixed problems I had or complex instructions that I had to puzzle out (Samba, Irssi etc). And maybe a post so that I don&#8217;t have to keep reiterating the same thing to every newcomer on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberrypi">r/raspberrypi</a>. So don&#8217;t expect perfect posts. Most if not all will be ramblings of my mind that were passed through a spell-check and a (Flesch-Kincaid Reading Test)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test] so I know I&#8217;m half-awake and somewhat coherent. If anyone has any questions or requests for further information, you can leave a comment and I&#8217;ll hopefully get back to you.</p>

<p>Note: That first lorem ipsum post will probably stay forever. Cause its HISTORY and cause nobody probably gives a sh*t.</p>

<p>Note2: If you didn&#8217;t realize, there are three links in this post and they don&#8217;t show up easily and look the same as the rest of the test. I&#8217;ll figure out why later and fix it soon. Hopefully.</p>
